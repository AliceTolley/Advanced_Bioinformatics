Masters in Genomic Medicine: Advanced Bioinformatics

Bash: Within a linux-shell under King's College London HPC's, I created an automatic NGS pipeline calling variants within whole-exome sequencing data.

R: Further developing my R coding skills, I produced heatmaps, principle component analysis and fold enrichment analysis of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.
